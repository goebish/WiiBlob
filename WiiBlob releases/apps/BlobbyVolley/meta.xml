	<long_description>Blobby volley is a really fun and addictive volley ball game. Basically you are a little blob that plays volley ball. You sort of look like a squishy jelly bean. Each player (Blob) can be controlled either by the player or the computer. So you can play against an AI opponent or a friend.</long_description>
